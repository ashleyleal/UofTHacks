# journa
journa is a UofTHacks 2023 submission by Ashley L, Danelle D, Winnie H, and Zuha M.

Introducing "journa" - the ultimate tool for self-discovery and personal growth. This innovative app helps you track your mood, set intentions, and journal your thoughts and feelings. With journa, you'll be able to gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your emotions, set and achieve goals, and create positive habits that will last a lifetime.

Inspiration:
We believe journalling is a very good habit for maintaining good mental well-being. Journaling can be a way to get in touch with your emotions, understand what you're feeling, and process any difficult experiences you may have had.

Writing about your thoughts and feelings can be a way to release pent-up emotions and feelings of stress and anxiety. It can help you to become more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and patterns of behavior, which can lead to greater insight and understanding of yourself by clarifying your thoughts and feelings and making it easier to identify problems and find solutions.

Reflecting on your accomplishments and progress can help to build self-esteem and confidence. It also helps to focus your mind on the present moments and be mindful.

What it does:
The app is simple and easy to use, with a clean and minimalist design that has a mood-tracking and journaling feature to record and organize your thoughts for self-exploration by reflecting on your emotions and feelings. It presents a daily quote for users to reflect on throughout the day and inspire self-discovery.

The mood tracking feature allows you to record and visualize your mood throughout the month/week. You can easily track your emotions, such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. The app includes a gratitude journal, where you can reflect on what you're grateful for and how it makes you feel.

The journaling feature is designed to help you explore your thoughts and feelings. You can write about anything that's on your mind, and the app will help you organize your entries by date and topic. All of these lead to a better mental state, promoting positivity therefore a means of supporting mental well-being.

How we built it:
We built it using React Native in JavaScript, on Visual Studio Code.

Challenges we ran into:
It was a challenge to find a common ground between the additional sponsor challenges and the main theme of 'Exploration'. While thinking about the theme of the project, we were also in a dilemma about the type of the language and framework to choose to generate an app.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
Our team has embarked on an exciting new journey, using React Native to create our first app. From the downloading JavaScript to use React Native, and then collaborating on Visual Studio Code, learning was multifaceted. Our hard work has paid off, as we've successfully developed an app that allows users to record and track their journal entries and moods.

What we learned:
In the process of exploring mental health and self-awareness, in addition to learning JavaScript and React Native, we also understand more about personalities and psychologies. The events from UofTHacks encouraged us to enhance our programming skills, participate in numerous interesting activities, and integrate into the hacker family!

What's next for Journa:
We do consider adding new features that would enhance the user experience, such as the ability to set reminders, track progress, or share quotes and journal entries with friends. The app will be regularly updated with new quotes and sayings to keep the content fresh and engaging for users.

It will also allow users to customize the look and feel of the app, or to choose from different themes or color schemes. We may offer premium subscriptions that will give users access to additional features, such as more quotes, more journaling prompts, or personalized feedback from experts.
